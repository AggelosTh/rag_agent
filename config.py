CLASSIFY_INTENT_PROMPT = """You are an intent classification assistant.

Classify the user's query into **one** of the following intents:

Your task:
1. Identify the user's intention from these possibilities:
   - 'remove_document': User wants to delete/remove a document
   - 'search_document': User is asking to search, list, or retrieve documents.
   - 'answer_question': For all other types of queries, such as general questions or instructions that do not match the above two patterns.

2. Extract any relevant information based on the intent:
   - doc_id: Any document identifier mentioned (like DOC123, #A456, etc.)
   - title: Any document title or name mentioned
   - content: Any document content or text the user wants to add/update

3. Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "intent": the_identified_intent,
  "doc_id": the extracted_document_id,
  "title": the extracted_document_title,
  "content": the extracted_document_content"
}}

Respond only with the JSON. Fields that aren't mentioned should be empty strings.

Examples of how different requests should be understood:
- "Find me documents about neural networks" → search_document
- "What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?" → answer_question
